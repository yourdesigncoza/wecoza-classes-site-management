---[ ] NAME:Remove PHP Search Filtering Logic DESCRIPTION:Remove the PHP-based search filtering from the data transformation section in list.php, ensuring all cached data is loaded into the table HTML without filtering.
---[ ] NAME:Prepare Table Structure for JavaScript Control DESCRIPTION:Ensure all table rows are rendered in HTML with proper data attributes, and prepare the table structure for JavaScript-based show/hide pagination control.
---[ ] NAME:Configure Pagination Container Visibility DESCRIPTION:Set up the existing #sites-pagination-container to be visible and properly styled, ready for JavaScript-generated pagination controls.
---[ ] NAME:Enqueue JavaScript Module in WordPress DESCRIPTION:Add the sites-table-pagination.js file to the WordPress asset enqueue system and ensure proper loading order and dependencies.
--[ ] NAME:Implement Search Integration with Pagination DESCRIPTION:Integrate the existing search input with JavaScript-based filtering and pagination, ensuring search works seamlessly with the 5-per-page display and resets pagination appropriately.

---[ ] NAME:Handle Pagination Visibility Logic DESCRIPTION:Implement logic to show/hide pagination controls based on the number of results (hide when â‰¤5 sites, show when >5 sites).
--[ ] NAME:Test and Optimize Performance DESCRIPTION:Test the pagination implementation with various data scenarios, verify performance remains optimal, and ensure all functionality works correctly with cached data.
---[ ] NAME:Test with Various Data Scenarios DESCRIPTION:Test pagination functionality with empty database, single site, exactly 5 sites, and multiple pages of sites to ensure proper behavior in all scenarios.
---[ ] NAME:Verify Performance Benchmarks DESCRIPTION:Measure and verify that pagination implementation maintains the current fast loading performance and doesn't impact initial table population speed.
---[ ] NAME:Test Search and Pagination Integration DESCRIPTION:Verify that search functionality works correctly with pagination, including search result pagination, empty search results, and search term persistence.
