## 3. Quality Assurance / Testing

* ✅ **Proactive Cache Invalidation:** Immediate cache clearing after CRUD operations
* ✅ **Database Performance:** Simplified cache validation eliminates unnecessary COUNT queries
* ✅ **Cache Consistency:** Deterministic cache management with proper error handling
* ✅ **Security Maintenance:** All capability checks and nonce verification preserved
* ✅ **MVC Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns maintained throughout refactoring
* ✅ **Error Handling:** Comprehensive logging and fallback mechanisms implemented
* ✅ **Code Quality:** Simplified codebase with improved maintainability

## 4. Technical Achievements

* **Cache Performance:** Eliminated COUNT-based validation for faster page loads
* **Proactive Invalidation:** Immediate cache clearing ensures data consistency
* **Centralized Management:** Single point of cache control through plugin class
* **Code Simplification:** Removed internationalization overhead for better performance
* **Security Preservation:** Maintained all security measures during refactoring
* **Database Optimization:** Continued focus on eliminating N+1 query patterns
* **System Cleanup:** Streamlined asset loading and reduced unnecessary dependencies

## 5. Blockers / Notes

* **Cache Strategy:** Proactive invalidation approach provides better consistency than count-based validation
* **Performance Impact:** Simplified cache system should improve page load times significantly
* **Internationalization:** Removed i18n functions - consider impact if multi-language support needed in future
* **Asset Loading:** Commented out CSS/JS assets may need re-evaluation for production deployment
* **Database Indexes:** Previous recommendation for site_name and address field indexes still pending
* **Testing Environment:** User cannot perform testing - monitor production deployment carefully
